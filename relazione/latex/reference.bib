  abstract = {In this paper we present a heuristic based upon genetic algorithms for the multidimensional knapsack problem. A heuristic operator which utilises problem-specific knowledge is incorporated into the standard genetic algorithm approach. Computational results show that the genetic algorithm heuristic is capable of obtaining high-quality solutions for problems of various characteristics, whilst requiring only a modest amount of computational effort. Computational results also show that the genetic algorithm heuristic gives superior quality solutions to a number of other heuristics.},
